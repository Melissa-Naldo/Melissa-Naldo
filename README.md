- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Melissa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working in Data Analytics using Excel, SQL, Power BI and Tableau. In the future I would like to learn how to better use the basic knowledge of R that I acquired and also learn Python. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using my skills to work with NIQ BASES as a research analyst in the Design Team.
